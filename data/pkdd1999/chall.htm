<H2>Motivation</H2>

<P>
Knowledge discovery in real-world databases requires a
broad scope of techniques and forms of knowledge.  Both the knowledge
and the applied methods should fit the discovery tasks and should
adapt to knowledge hidden in the data.  PKDD'99 Discovery Challenge
will encourage a collaborative research effort, a broad and unified view of
knowledge and methods of discovery, and emphasis on business problems and solutions
to those problems.</P>  

<!--
<P>From the data processing point of view, the whole KDD process has to 
cover tasks like data extraction, sampling, data integration and homogenization, data cleaning, data 
transformation  (which all can be understood as preprocessing steps preceding the actual mining phase),
 the data mining step itself,  as well as the evaluation and (often manual) interpretation of the 
mining results.  From the application point of view, the KDD should help to solve some real problems by
 offering tools for better understanding the data.</P>
-->

<!--
<P>The Discovery Challenge should constitute a collection of data and problems as a common ground for 
better comparisons and discussions of the applicability of KDD methods on a real-world problems with 
respect to both KDD and application viewpoints. The main goals of the
Discovery Challenge are</P>
<UL>
<LI>stimulate an open view of knowledge and discovery
<LI>stimulate collaborative approach to KDD and research on unification of
both different forms of knowledge and discovery
<LI>integrate into KDD an emphasis on business problems and solutions to
those problems
</UL>
-->

&nbsp;
<H2>Time and place</H2>
<P>The  Discovery Challenge will be held as a part of the 3rd European Conference on Principles and 
Practice of  Knowledge Discovery in Databases (PKDD’99), September 15 - 18, 1999, Prague, Czech 
Republic. Only those registered for PKDD’99 can participate in the discovery challenge.</P>

&nbsp;

<H2>Data sets</H2>
Two real-world dataset are available to all prospective
PKDD'99 conference participants.
<H3>
<UL>
<LI><a href=berka.htm> Financial domain</a>
<LI><a href =tsumoto.htm> Medical domain</a>
</UL>
</H3>

Each dataset is described in a separate document. The meaning of data
as well as a sample of exploration tasks are included in each
document.    


<P>In the financial domain, the dataset consists of 8 tables describing clients
of a bank, their accounts, transactions, permanent orders, granted loans and
issued credit cards. 
In the medical domain, the dataset consists of 3 tables describing
patients with collagen diseases.
</P>

<H2>Discovery Challenge guidelines</H2>

<!--
<P>Contributions are expected to present the problem definition, the 
necessary preprocessing steps, the applying of  data mining algorithms (either own or third-party 
approaches) and the interpretation of results (in terms of  both KDD and bank points of view). 
The main emphasis of the reported experiments should lie on the application methodology.</P>
-->

<OL>
<LI> Each participant can use any KDD techniques and discover as much
knowledge as possible. <BR> Ideally each submitted contribution will include 
<UL>
<LI>  the proposed business objectives (goals that may be of interest to
database users), 
<LI> a brief summary of datamining effort; this summary may include
the data preprocessing tasks like data extraction, sampling, data integration and 
homogenization, data cleaning, data transformation, the data mining step as well as the 
evaluation criteria apporwed,
<LI> presentation of the discovered knowledge, and 
<LI>  an explanation for database users how they can apply the discovered knowledge.
</UL>

Since the results may be unexpected, the final applications may be
different from those initially proposed.
        
<LI> In order to reach a common framework for comparisons, the
presentation of the discovered knowledge should include a clear
summary of the predictions it makes possible.  Ideally, such a summary
shows parts of the entire dataset that can be removed from data
because they can be predicted by the discovered knowledge nad the remaining data.

<LI> The deadline for camera-ready contributions is August 9, 1999.  Soon
afterwards each database coordinator and the Discovery Challenge Chair
will 
<!-- make acceptance decisions and --> 
issue the schedule of presentations.   

<LI> All presentation will be done during a sequence of special
sessions.  The time allocated for each presentation will be about 20
minutes.

<LI> Ample time will be provided during and after the special sessions
for interaction between participants.  The discussion will be aimed at
a joint representation of knowledge and method, and on a synthesis of
all contributions. 

<LI>
 A panel at a joint plenary session will summarize the main findings
and problems generated by the Challenge.

<LI> A plan for a joint publication will be drafted at the conference,
with each author's role defined.  Joint publication will put all
discoveries in a unified perspective.
</OL>                                      


<P>Submitted papers should be in English and not exceed 6 single-spaced pages. 
Use 10pt font, the printed area being 22.5cm (9in) height and 16.3cm (6.5in)
width in the center of each page; pages not numbered. The paper must be 
submitted to Petr Berka by <B>August 9th, 1999</B>.  We prefer electronic submission of 
PostScript files by e-mail
  or using the “submit contribution” option from the PKDD’99 Web homepage.
All 
<!-- accepted --> 
contributions  will be 
published in a technical report of the University of Economics.</P>

<!--
<p> All presentations will be done during a special session. The participants
will compare their results and their methods.
All contributions  will be 
published in a technical report of the University of Economics. We also
think about publishing some contributions in an international journal.</P>

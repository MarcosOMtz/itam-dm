<H1>PKDD'99 Discovery Challenge</H1>
<H1>Guide to the Financial Data Set</H1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<H2>Domain</H2>

<P>Once upon a time, there was a bank offering services to private
persons. The services include managing of accounts, offering loans, etc. 
The bank wants to improv
their services by finding interesting groups of clients (e.g. to
differentiate between good and bad clients). The bank managers have only
vague idea,
who is good client (whom to offer some additional services) and who is bad
client (whom to watch
carefully to minimize the bank looses). Fortunately, the bank stores data
about their clients, the
accounts (transactions within several months), the loans already granted,
the credit cards issued
 So the bank managers hope to find some answers (and questions as well) by
analyzing this data.</P>

&nbsp;
<H2>Task description</H2>
 
<P>The discovery challenge task is to</P>
 
<UL>
<LI>define a problem which can help the bank to improve their services (e.g.
define the notion of
good or bad client, suggest  new/current service that can be offered to a
group of clients etc.);
from the KDD point of view the problem can be classification, prediction or
description,</LI>
<LI>show how KDD can be used to solve the problem (even if the results are
not much significant
from the KDD point of view, they can be important for the bank). </LI></UL>
 
<P> Each participant can use any KDD techniques and discover as much
knowledge as possible. Ideally each approach will include 1. proposed goals,
2. details of datamining, and 3. demonstrated use of the results. Since the
results of discovery may be unexpected, the applications may be different
from those initially proposed.</p>




&nbsp;
<H2>Data description</H2>

<IMG SRC="data.gif" ALIGN="CENTER">
 
 
<P>The data about the clients and their accounts consist of following
relations:</P>
 
<UL>
<LI>relation<B> account</B> (4500 objects in the file ACCOUNT.ASC) - each
record describes static characteristics of an account,
<LI>relation <B>client</B> (5369 objects in the file CLIENT.ASC) - each
record describes characteristics of a client,
<LI>relation <B>disposition</B> (5369 objects in the file DISP.ASC) - each
record relates together  a client with an account,
<LI>relation <B>permanent order</B> (6471 objects in the file ORDER.ASC) -
each record describes characteristics of  a payment order,
<LI>relation <B>transaction</B> (1056320 objects in the file TRANS.ASC) -
each record describes  one transaction on an account,
<LI>relation <B>loan</B> (682 objects in the file LOAN.ASC) - each record
describes a loan granted  for a given account,
<LI>relation <B>credit card</B>  (892 objects in the file CARD.ASC) - each
record describes a  credit card issued to an account,
<LI>relation <B>demographic data</B> (77 objects in the file DISTRICT.ASC) -
each record describes  demographic characteristics of a district.
</UL>
 
<P>Each account has both static characteristics (e.g. date of creation,
address of the branch) given
in relation "account" and dynamic characteristics (e.g. payments debited or
credited, balances) given
in relations "permanent order" and "transaction". Relation "client"
describes characteristics of
persons who can manipulate with the accounts. One client can have more
accounts, more clients can
manipulate with single account; clients and accounts are related together in
relation "disposition".
Relations "loan" and  "credit card" describe some services which the bank
offers to its clients;
more credit cards can be issued to an account, at most one loan can be
granted for an account. Relation
"demographic data" gives some publicly available information about the
districts (e.g. the
unemployment rate); additional information about the clients can be deduced
from this.</P>
